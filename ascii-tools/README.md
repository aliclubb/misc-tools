ascii-tools
==========

	This is a collection of tools I am developing to deal with ASCII related conversion.
	So far it does strings to ASCII values (-ascii) and ASCII values to strings (-char) :)
	
	NOTE: The char to html function works for most characters, but breaks upon characters such as Ã©
	being entered. Also, html to ascii and html to char are currently not supported. I will add support
	when I find the time.
